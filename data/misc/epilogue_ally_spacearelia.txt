Saito's downfall was not swift or easy. He clung to power for years, fighting viciously to defend each meter of territory he had seized, only falling back after suffering and extracting bloody casualties on both sides. A major coalition of megacorps and affiliated organizations ultimately brought him down, but his fate was sealed after California's human populace turned against him.

The dream of metahuman equality remained elusive, but administration officials like Lina and Tassender continued to pursue it, using the new tools at their disposal.

When people talk about the People's University, they first think of the Conqueror of Camelot, a runner who traveled into orbit to save the people of Earth.

Their love for each other was stronger than Saito's hate, and Californians remembered that love long after the Protectorate was gone.
