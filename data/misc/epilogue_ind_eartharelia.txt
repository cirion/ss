Saito's downfall was not swift or easy. He clung to power for years, fighting viciously to defend each meter of territory he had seized, only falling back after suffering and extracting bloody casualties on both sides. A major coalition of megacorps and affiliated organizations ultimately brought him down, but his fate was sealed after California's human populace turned against him. In the end, the message of the People's University was every bit as important as Ares' bombers or the Rangers' tanks. Ideas led to actions, and those actions ended the Protectorate.

The PU was most famous for its heroic, doomed defense of Orkland. Abandoned by the resistance, they stood alone, inflicting great casualties on the Protectorate before finally fleeing. The library was destroyed, the Matrix host unplugged, but the PU was never just a building or a server. Its former members scattered throughout California, spreading their message and the uprising. Years later, shut out of Dorbi's post-Saito regime, they continued the same mission, advocating for metahuman equality and universal freedom.

When people talk about the People's University, they first think of the Conqueror of Camelot, a runner who traveled into orbit to save the people of Earth. The troll healer Arelia carried the message of this great sacrifice to the people, striking a spark that ignited the flames of rebellion. Even in death, their love for each other was stronger than Saito's hate, and Californians remembered that love long after the Protectorate was gone.

There is no shadow without light. No dusk without dawn. The world turns, but it is people who push it. The Runner of Redding, the Hero of Halferville, and the Conqueror of Camelot have joined the ranks of those who tilt the world on its axis. Through their struggles and triumphs, they have altered the course of the Sixth World, bringing life and hope to those who needed it most.
