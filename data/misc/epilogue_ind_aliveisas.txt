Saito's downfall was not swift or easy. He clung to power for years, fighting viciously to defend each meter of territory he had seized, only falling back after suffering and extracting bloody casualties on both sides. A major coalition of megacorps and affiliated organizations ultimately brought him down, but his fate was sealed after California's human populace turned against him. In the end, the message of the People's University was every bit as important as Ares' bombers or the Rangers' tanks. Ideas led to actions, and those actions ended the Protectorate.

The PU was most famous for its heroic, doomed defense of Orkland. Abandoned by the resistance, they stood alone, inflicting great casualties on the Protectorate before finally fleeing. The library was destroyed, the Matrix host unplugged, but the PU was never just a building or a server. Its former members scattered throughout California, spreading their message and the uprising. Years later, shut out of Dorbi's post-Saito regime, they continued the same mission, advocating for metahuman equality and universal freedom.

The People's University was ultimately made up of individuals, and the most famous were the Conqueror of Camelot and the Oni Isao. After a dramatic trip into orbit, this unlikely pair's love was seen throughout California, a living counterexample to Saito's hate. Californians ultimately chose love, joining the rebellion to help create a world where it could flourish.

There is no shadow without light. No dusk without dawn. The world turns, but it is people who push it. The Runner of Redding, the Hero of Halferville, and the Conqueror of Camelot have joined the ranks of those who tilt the world on its axis. Through their struggles and triumphs, they have altered the course of the Sixth World, bringing life and hope to those who needed it most.
