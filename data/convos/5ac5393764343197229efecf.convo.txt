  text: "Desorn was born when I decided to create a pure-pacifist character. One of my main design goals for CalFree in Chains was to add more non-lethal options to the game.\n\nI mostly focused on making missions that could be completed through stealth or social manipulation, but I also wanted to try adding non-lethal combat-oriented gameplay."

  text: "I did something similar with Emperor Norton back in Antumbra Saga. That character was a pacifist shaman, who didn\'t have any attack skills or spells, but had an impressive set of buffing spells. I wanted to try something a little different with Desorn. Inspired by Duncan\'s Crowd Control abilities, I dug through the new features in Hong Kong to see what I could do."

  text: "Desorn ends up playing like a combination of Gaichu and Duncan. Like Gaichu, he moves through a sequence of stances, with his attacks becoming more powerful with each successive hit. Like Duncan, he can do AP damage to enemies and completely disable them once they\'re stunned.\n\nHe can be very effective, especially if you give him a third AP via Haste to enable his best attack, and/or if your main character can also stun characters so Desorn can focus on subduing them."

  text: "I love when characters\' storylines and gameplay are united. Duncan\'s crowd control abilities didn\'t seem to come up much in conversation, but Desorn is wholly defined by his pacifist tendencies, which inform all of his dialogues with you and are reflected by his behavior in the field."

  text: "I suspect that Desorn is a polarizing character. Players generally dislike being lectured to, and Desorn has strong opinions about the right and wrong way to solve problems, opinions that probably seem wildly unrealistic. His dialogue also has strong religious connotations, which I suspect will rub many players the wrong way."

  text: "Depending on your preferences, you may choose to pursue a romantic relationship with Desorn. I tend to play romances against type, and that trend continues here. Desorn is sensitive and courteous, not a typical male love interest and certainly not what you would expect in Shadowrun. This romance is sweet and almost-chaste, in keeping with my understanding of his character."

  text: "I suspect that many players\' opinions on Desorn will have shifted by the middle of the game. He gets a raw deal, and you might find yourself missing aspects of him that previously struck you as annoying or frustrating.\n\nOn the other hand, people may view what happens to Desorn as the ultimate rebuke, as proof that his high-minded idealism has no place in this broken world."
