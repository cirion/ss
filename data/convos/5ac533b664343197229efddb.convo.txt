  text: "I\'ve always brought a single companion forward from a prequel to a sequel, providing a point of continuity to the new storyline. Dalmin bridged the original Antumbra with Eclipse, Hailey linked Eclipse with Corona, Dorbi tied Corona to The Caldecott Caper, and now Kora has united The Caldecott Caper with CalFree in Chains. Kora and Dorbi are the only two crew members who are guaranteed to survive the events of Caldecott, so she was an easy choice."

  text: "The circumstances of her arrival might be a little different. Depending on your actions during The Caldecott Caper, Kora\'s romantic partner Rafik might have perished from Hemlock poisoning. Because you\'re playing as a new character, and might not have even played Caldecott, I don\'t have any way of determining Rafik\'s status."

  text: "So, I mention Rafik during an early conversation with Kora and invite you to define his status: this allows me to shore up the narrative continuity, and based on your in-game reaction I can make Kora respond appropriately. I avoid doing this often, since it takes more effort and adds extra complexity, but it\'s a crucial element of Kora\'s life and so I thought the effort was justified here. Rafik\'s death has a devastating impact on Kora, and it felt unrealistic to gloss over the difference this would make, even after a few years have passed."

  text: "Kora might be the most boring member of your party, but I love her: she\'s a sweetheart, kind and selfless and resolute. She provides insight into the shifts in the People\'s University, and her dialogue helps show how the organization has been thrust from its originally purely pacifist tradition into a more combative role. I liked keeping this in tension, showing how she can feel guilty about this change even while being convinced it was necessary."

  text: "She also pays you out between missions. This was a change from The Caldecott Caper. In the earlier game, the whole plot revolved around getting money for your operation, so it seemed weird to have fixer payouts, and instead you would pick up extra nuyen while on-mission.\n\nIn CalFree in Chains, though, you\'re explicitly hired for your shadowrunning expertise. Kora therefore behaves more like a traditional fixer, albeit a far more idealistic one than in most shadowruns."

  text: "Her content sort of peters out near the end of the game. All of your companions have six substantive \"Friendship\" conversations over the course of the game. These are somewhat spread out, but since Kora is the one companion who is around from the first until the very last mission, you\'ll likely exhaust her dialogues before other characters\'. You\'ll probably still have plenty to discuss with other crew members, so the total amount of content should be similar, but it may seem like Kora sort of runs out of things to say near the end."
