  text: "There are many options for naming the club. Most of them are puns based off of real-world music venues in Oakland or San Francisco. The Faux Theater is based on The Fox Theater, Bottom of the Kill is based on Bottom of the Hill, The Centurion Saloon is based on The Legionnaire Saloon, and so on. This is one of the many, many parts of the game that I made entirely to amuse myself."
