  text: "The Shadows of Hong Kong expansion came out several months after I released The Caldecott Caper. I loved it: I thought the pacing was fantastic, the missions were interesting, and the new gear was fun. As a modder, I was also delighted by the new tile sets. In particular the underwater research lab was one of the prettiest things I\'ve seen in the engine, and I was determined to make use of it if I ever made a new campaign."

  text: "Like Sacramento, this is another level that can be completed without any fighting, and most players will probably try to do that on their initial playthrough. Once you know what\'s going on in here, though, you might come to regret your mercy, and I suspect that more players will choose to charge in guns-blazing if they play it again."
