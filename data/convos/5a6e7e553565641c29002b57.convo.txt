  text: "I had a blast putting together this Matrix-defense encounter. It\'s another thing that\'s technically possible in the Shadowrun engine but hasn\'t been used in the official campaigns. You can set IC to be friendly just as easily as you can set them to be hostile, and with just a little scripting work you can make hostile deckers move around and try to take down friendly Blocker IC."

  text: "Of course, most players aren\'t expecting this. That\'s always a challenge: I want to do things differently from the official campaigns, because it\'s exciting for me as a developer. But any time I break with tradition, I risk confusing and upsetting players who are used to the game behaving a different way.\n\nFor this level, I tried to mitigate that issue by using differently-colored IC, which will hopefully help clue in players that they may be different from the usual."

  text: "The simultaneous meatspace combat adds an extra level of fun to this. This might be the biggest and most sprawling single fight of the entire campaign, with multiple waves of enemies and evolving objectives. Your team needs to keep moving between various areas to face the encroaching foes, and the Matrix invasion adds one more complication.\n\nThese are my favorite kinds of fights, especially because Deckers get to deck while the rest of the team is still busy, each person supporting and defending the other. They\'re complex to set up, so there aren\'t too many examples here or in the official campaigns, but I\'m glad to add them when I can."
