  text: "One of the last things I do when creating a campaign is name each mission. It\'s also one of the most fun things I do! I get a kick out of brainstorming each one and narrowing it down to my favorite.\n\nSome of the mission titles are extremely obscure references that I don\'t expect anyone to get, while others may be instantly recognizable. My personal favorites, though, are when the same title can convey multiple meanings: perhaps an obvious one at the start of the mission, and a more subtle or surprising one by the end."

In the real world, Sweeney Ridge is the site of the old Nike Missile Site SF-51, a Cold War-era anti-aircraft defense system designed to shoot down bombers invading over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Nike was the goddess of power and victory, and evokes the battlefield power you can wield at the conclusion of this mission."
