  text: "This room performs many functions. One is to suggest the passage of time. After you complete a mission, you \"wake up\" in your bedroom, which implies that at least a day has elapsed since the previous events.\n\nI appreciate it when games add little intermissions like this; otherwise, it can seem like your character runs around non-stop without any rest for the entire game."

  text: "I\'m deliberately vague about when the game takes place and how much time elapses. Canonically, Saito conquered Sacramento by late November 2061, so it presumably starts around that time. Yasuhito became Emperor of Japan in early January 2062 and rescinds the Yomi Island Decree in February. The Year of the Comet ends in April and SURGE tapers off around that time. Lofwyr resigns from the Tir Tairgnire Council of Princes in June, and Hestaby takes his place in July. Both of those events presumably happen after the end of this campaign."

  text: "My personal assumption is that roughly one week elapses between missions, which would realistically give sufficient time to perform the necessary legwork, equip your team, and manage infiltration and exfiltration from the mission site.\n\nAgain, though, the in-game dialogue doesn\'t directly address timelines, so you might imagine a more or less frenzied pace."

  text: "Most people will probably run right out of the bedroom without lingering, but a few observant players might notice changes over the course of the game, and even more across multiple playthroughs. This game can\'t accommodate dynamic decorations in the manner of games like Skyrim, but I wanted to have some level of personalization that would make each player\'s room a little unique."

  text: "Most of the changes are driven by your character\'s build. If you are skilled at Ranged Weapons, some of the posters on the wall will be replaced by gun displays, showcasing your arsenal. As your Ranged Weapons skill increases, your arsenal will grow larger. Those who are skilled at Melee Weapons will instead see melee weapons on display, while people who have leveled Decking will see cyberdecks lying on their counters, Spellcasters will see arcane artifacts, and so on. These are subtle additions, but ideally contribute to the feeling that this is a personal space for you."

There\'s little reason to raise Biotech above level 2, but if you do, you\'ll start to receive free medkits between runs.\n\nSimilarly, summoning shamans have felt underpowered in the Hong Kong engine, but those who play this archetype in CalFree in Chains will replenish personal fetishes between runs."
