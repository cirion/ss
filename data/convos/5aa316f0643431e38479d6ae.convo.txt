  text: "It\'s not just (hopefully) visually striking: it\'s also intended as a strong thematic statement. A lot of this story has been about balancing your character\'s selfish needs and desires against the broader pains of metahumanity. This scene is sort of a visual representation of that. As you\'re fighting for survival up in orbit, you\'re constantly aware of the vastly greater number of people suffering below. That raises the importance of what you\'re doing, while simultaneously making it clearer that you\'re only a tiny part of a much larger struggle."

  text: "The idea of the Protectorate attacking the Library at the same time that you\'re invading Camelot came VERY late in development. The finale was feeling under-dramatic, and I thought it would add a sense of urgency to the proceedings.\n\nOnce I thought of that, though, it ended up making everything that happened in the game before feel more meaningful. Now those choices you had previously made weren\'t just interesting in their own right, but also had a mechanical impact on the final fight."

  text: "It added a lot more complexity to the final fight, which is... mostly good. It made things a little hard to tune. There are two battles going on: the space battle, which you are directly fighting, and the planetside battle. You can slightly influence the planetside battle by sending or intercepting commands, but for the most part the planetside battle will be determined by your previous actions and decisions."

If you\'ve done very well with your preparations and in-combat actions, the Berkeley partisans can actually fight off the wave of Protectorate soldiers before succumbing. Alternately, if you can capture Camelot prior to either side winning down below, whoever currently holds the advantage will claim victory without inflicting more casualties."

  text: "There\'s one other, minor wrinkle to this fight, the reinforcements. The drones that appear late in the battle can hit VERY hard, destroying your armor and dealing significant damage. They\'re glass cannons, though, and if you can damage them in the Matrix or by focusing fire, you should be able to escape without too much trouble."

  text: "Overall I\'m pretty happy with how the fight turned out. Because of the significant potential variation in preparation that different players may have made in advance, it might feel too easy or too hard for certain players. But even in those cases, hopefully it at least seems INTERESTING, with different factors to track and some tradeoffs to consider."
