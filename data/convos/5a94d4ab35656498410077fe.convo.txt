  text: "This is the last mission in the campaign that you can complete without any combat. Again, though, I want that to be a roleplaying choice rather than a simple matter of success or failure. By this time you\'ve witnessed the horror that the Protectorate is inflicting on its metahuman citizens. Is it actually good to spare the warriors who are propping up the regime and carrying out its policies?\n\nBut, then again, it\'s one thing to kill mindless aimless fighters, and another to kill Otsuka the unfairly-punished clerk scrubbing toilets, or Sano the harried leader swamped by bureaucracy. The Protectorate is a force for evil, but it\'s made up of individuals, and when you see them in that light it can be harder to just say \"They deserve to die!\""

  text: "Mechanically, this section inside follows the \"Suspicion\" counter that I first used during the heist in The Caldecott Caper. I like how this works: it allows for multiple small failures on the player\'s part without necessarily dooming the entire venture.\n\nThere are a few things that can tilt the odds in your favor. Being a pureblooded human helps! Wiping out the MPA outside and bringing in a trophy will earn you some slack. But even if you don\'t have either of those, you can still get through peacefully, provided you\'re extremely careful not to draw unwanted attention to yourself."

  text: "Unlike the heist in Caldecott, suspicion helps a little more here. The main \"check\" is with Sano, but there\'s an optional objective later on that involves planting explosives. Having a low suspicion will give you a better buffer for discovery while doing this."

  text: "The patrolling soldiers become more of a threat when you\'re planting explosives, as you\'ll need to keep your distance from them. I did very little with patrols in my first two campaigns... it\'s always been a really solid mechanic of the base game engine, but rarely fit any of my scenes. Here, though, it works really well for depicting military guards, and can provide a little variety in gameplay."
