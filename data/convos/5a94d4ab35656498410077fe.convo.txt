Again, though, I want combat to be a roleplaying choice rather than a simple matter of success or failure.\n\nBy this time you\'ve witnessed the horror that the Protectorate is inflicting on its metahuman citizens. Is it actually good to spare the warriors who prop up the regime and carry out its policies?"

The Protectorate is a force for evil, but it\'s made up of individuals, and when you see them in that light it can be harder to just say \"They deserve to die!\""
