  text: "This map is based off of one of my favorite hiking trails, the Sweeney Ridge trail. It has fantastic views of the Pacific Ocean, the Farallon Islands, San Francisco Bay, Oakland, and mountains for miles around. It\'s also the site of an abandoned missile targeting complex from the Cold War, which is now run-down and tagged like the version shown on this map."

  text: "I was really happy to finally have the chance to make a nature-based map. My early experiences with Shadowrun were with the SNES and Genesis games, which included large sections out in nature. To me, locations like the Salish-Shidhe Wilderness are just as much a part of Shadowrun as places like the Barrens.\n\nI\'m limited by the artwork within the game, though, and up until now all of the games have been exclusively urban. Fortunately, Hong Kong added some great-looking green grass, trees, shrubs, and various other plants, so I could finally make a map like this."
