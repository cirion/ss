  text: "In my Caldecott commentary I mentioned how important clubs are for me. I got into Shadowrun in the 90s, when clubs felt like THE defining environment of Shadowrun: where you meet the Johnson, where you assemble the crew, where you do your legwork and collect intel.\n\nThat\'s much less true in modern-day Shadowrun, but it\'s a torch that I want to continue shining."

  text: "Early in my planning phase, I fell in love with the idea of your runner building a club. I\'ve long thought that the Shadowrun engine is particularly strong at creating environments that change over time: it\'s surprisingly easy to make things appear, disappear, or alter based on shifting variables."

  text: "I\'d taken an earlier crack at this in Redding Old City Hall near the end of Antumbra Saga, which would upgrade over time in response to your decisions. That was a lot of fun to create, but not especially fun to experience: players couldn\'t easily connect the cause and effect, so it wasn\'t obvious how their choices were impacting the environment. This time around, I wanted a much clearer impact. Someone asks you to get a new floor, you pay someone to install a floor, then the next time you come back you can see the new floor."

I never remember to put any art on the walls or do anything interesting in the places where I live, but I can obsess for hours when deciding how to decorate the virtual spaces I create. I have no idea why this is.)"

  text: "From a gameplay perspective, these side-quests are mostly based around meeting civilians while out on your runs and using your skills to convince them to help you. Like all skill challenges, though, I want to provide a fallback in case your particular build doesn\'t meet any requirements. In this case, you can pay cash to complete any upgrades you missed while out on a run. This is more expensive than paying for it during the run, but since you get bigger nuyen payouts as the game progresses, you might prefer that. This essentially gives a way to transfer a fixed amount of nuyen into karma."

  text: "I liked those sidequests since they connected the hub with the missions and gave you something interesting to do, but they could be frustrating for players: if they missed a step in the sidequest, then they would never be able to complete it. The fallbacks in CalFree in Chains give players an opportunity to still finish the quest if they miss the main in-mission opportunity."
