  text: "I kind of went overboard on this level. It was the first one I designed for CalFree in Chains, and I sort of threw in everything and the kitchen sink. Even just in terms of the enemies: you can fight the Protectorate, Fuchi, the MPA, ghouls, mummies, and you-know-who. You cross a bunch of different environments, have a bunch of battles, solve multiple puzzles, recruit a new party member, advance the meta-plot, make big decisions, and have a challenging boss fight. Too much!"

  text: "I calmed down a little when designing the later missions. I usually want to include a variety of things to keep a run from being boring or stale, but I think FORGED IN BATTLE errs too far in the other direction.\n\nThat said, it may help a little that this mission comes early on. Hopefully it helps grab players\' interest and keep them motivated to keep playing through the campaign. It is kind of a showcase for the gameplay and plot you can expect from CalFree in Chains."

  text: "I\'ve come a long way since creating the Antumbra games, and I think comparing this graveyard to the Colma one is a good example. My earlier levels were too big and open, which was fun to create but not especially fun to play. I\'ve been leaning more and more towards smaller, tighter battlefields, which are more tactically interesting and more visually pleasing."

  text: "The crypt puzzle is also kind of a throwback to the Colma graveyard, which similarly required answering a riddle to proceed. This is sort of a tribute towards the earlier game. Loyal players who have gone through the earlier campaigns will recognize Shavarus and be rewarded with a quicker solution; newer players will still be able to solve it, but it might require using special skills or some trial-and-error."
