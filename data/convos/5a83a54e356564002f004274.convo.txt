  text: "This is one of the three most complex fights in the campaign. I love these sorts of setpieces, especially when there are shifting allegiances, environmental threats, tactical chokepoints, and strategic tradeoffs. Events will be impacted by earlier decisions (your choice about Novatech), current decisions (whether to deploy the toxic barrels), and your available resources (the ability to hack the Matrix and/or reset the electrical cooldown via drone)."

  text: "The fight is interesting, but honestly, it isn\'t particularly hard. It gets more and more difficult to keep battles engaging as the player\'s power scales: after you reach 3AP and start acquiring top-tier weapons and skills, the enemy AI just can\'t keep up. Adding custom bosses such as Rime keeps things fresh, though, and even if the battle is easy, hopefully it still feels worthwhile."
