  text: "I eventually decided to lead with Valiri, mostly because Arelia\'s already-sad story would seem unbearably depressing if it came to an early, violent end.\n\nValiri is much more vibrant and upbeat than Arelia, which causes a bigger contrast, and also seemed to strike a sort of emotional balance between her beginning and her end."

  text: "As I started writing Valiri, I became concerned that she was too similar to Persi from The Caldecott Caper. Both are enthusiastic and assertive women whose history of service to CalFree is tempered by disillusion. I tried to focus on differentiating their personalities. Persi was always a loner who followed her own lights, while Valiri is much more of a collaborator, trying to bring people together. Valiri is also more idealistic and drawn to higher causes, while Persi was more amoral and focused on experiences."

  text: "I also gave them different voices. Persi uses slang-filled jargon, while Valiri speaks more properly.\n\nI deliberately toned down Valiri\'s swearing while revising her dialogue. I think it would be realistic for her to swear more, especially as an ex-soldier, but I didn\'t want her foul mouth to be an obvious feature like it was with Persi."

  text: "I try to give each of your teammates a primary value: something that defines their outlook on life and strongly influences their reaction to any situation. Valiri\'s primary value is speed. She feels compelled to move forward, to act, to do something. She loathes debate and compromise and caution, and is never happier than when she\'s racing headlong towards her goal."

  text: "Like most major characters, Valiri fulfills expositionary duty in addition to her direct role in the story. She bears witness to the corrupt and ineffective CalFree government, which was contemptible in many ways but not nearly as vile as what replaced it. This is especially important for new runners who haven\'t played my previous CalFree campaigns! I\'ve been casting shade at Sacramento for years now, and Valiri\'s words help everyone catch up on the status quo ante."

  text: "Valiri\'s romance doesn\'t last very long, but if you pursue it, you can get a sense of what it would have been like. I particularly enjoyed giving her an outfit for this special occasion, which simultaneously shows how important you are to her and speaks volumes about her personal style and preferences. Her energy is enthusiastic and infectious: going out with her is like being carried along by a tidal wave, with you along for a very enjoyable ride."

  text: "Valiri\'s absence casts a pall, perhaps even more so than Desorn\'s. This is at least partly due to her team role: as a shaman, she has probably been a key part of your team composition, with universally useful buffs like Haste and the ability to Heal.\n\nAt some possibly-unconscious level, you may be shocked that I took away your healer. Mechanically, Arelia can fill in at least part of that gap, but there\'s still a hole that can never be completely filled."
