  text: "We\'re now entering the second of three vivid scenes that I had in my head when I first started work on this campaign. I imagined a \"tunnel of horror\", where the player would experience gradually increasing dread as they slowly came to understand the nature and scope of the evil posed by the Protectorate.\n\nUp until now, you have heard second-hand accounts of families being deported, discriminatory policies enacted by the government, human-supremacist ideology propagating through the populace. This is your chance to finally witness firsthand the consequence of these ideas. What previously might have seemed abstract or distant, a political dispute that doesn\'t directly affect you, becomes impossible to ignore."

  text: "The processing centers are described in \"Threats 2\", a Shadowrun sourcebook published by FanPro in 2001. That description, in turn, is probably influenced by the historic Nazi concentration camps of World War II, and I used elements from that period in detailing this center.\n\nThese sorts of facilities are certainly not unique, though. Closer to home, concentration camps were a significant element of the United States\' genocide of Native American tribes during the 19th century. We should be aware of our past, aware of our potential for evil, and actively work to prevent it from returning."

  text: "A steady escalation of unpleasant sensations, of dawning horror, lies ahead. You see a single specific example of a victim of the Protectorate. You find records that, while written in cold and clinical language, make it clear that the suffering behind you is being multiplied thousands upon thousands of times. You then witness innocents being gunned down in cold blood, seeing how their humanity is rejected. And then finally you experience the terrors of the gas chamber yourself, trapped inside the abattoir and surrounded by death. If I\'m doing my job properly, your heart might race a little as some of the fear crosses through the screen and into you."
