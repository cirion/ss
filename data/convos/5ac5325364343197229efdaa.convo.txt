  text: "I\'m not sure how many players have noticed this, but if you pan the camera to the south, near the base of the library, you\'ll see an electronic sign with scrolling text. Much like the \"SALE\" sign near Lina\'s shop, this text will change after every mission, providing a tiny bit of new content whenever you return."

  text: "Lina\'s sign is very simple and usually has only an abstract relation to the plot. The library sign does a little more work. It can give some insight into what the rest of the People\'s University is up to: you can see the collective\'s transformation into a more militant organization, their engagement with the community, and occasional commentary on the progress of your mission."
