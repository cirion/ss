  text: "Color puzzles are fairly fun for me to do. The Shadowrun engine has good support for lighting scripts, the logic is simple to track via variables, and it has a nicely visual focus that contrasts with the generally text-dominated puzzles elsewhere in the game. Antumbra Saga\'s light puzzle in the Colma crypt was fairly popular, and I decided to do something similar here."

  text: "Unfortunately, I failed to take my players\' accessibility issues into account: some people have color blindness, and so puzzles like this are pretty much impossible for them to solve. I belatedly added a work-around (available on the Steam page FAQ if you need it), but I wish I\'d considered that in advance. Particularly since the entire rest of the game doesn\'t require full color vision, it was thoughtless of me to add something like that here."

  text: "The puzzle itself did go through some iterations, especially during the alpha-test process. The pillars were initially laid out in a line, closer to the entrance of the cave, so it was much less obvious that it was a color wheel. (Which I thought at the time made it more interesting, but it was mostly just confusing.) It was also extremely hard to see what the actual colors were. I addressed the latter issue by shifting the ambient cave light to a more neutral hue instead of the rusty brown that fills the rest of the map."

  text: "The other \"puzzle\" in this mission is the moving cave walls. It isn\'t exactly a puzzle, since it isn\'t something you can solve. I wanted to introduce feelings of paranoia and claustrophobia, which would lead in to the more ominous doppelganger encounters near the end of the mission."

  text: "One unimportant but odd quirk of this is that the Shadowrun engine still treats an invisible wall as blocking line-of-sight. If you\'re very observant in the early stages of this map, you might notice that the fog-of-war isn\'t removed in some cases where you would expect it to be. This is a sign that you\'re passing through an area that will later turn into a solid wall. It doesn\'t affect anything, but is kind of interesting."
