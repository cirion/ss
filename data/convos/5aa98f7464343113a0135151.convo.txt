  text: "Believe it or not, this is the \"happy ending\" to the story. In my original vision, you would hear back from Earth as, one by one, every person at the People\'s University was cut down in battle. In order to advance through the levels on the station, one crew member would be left behind at each juncture, sacrificing themself so your mission could continue.\n\nThe game would end with just you and one other person, probably your love interest, debating who should return to Earth and who would remain behind."

  text: "I was, uh, in a bad mood when I wrote that.\n\nThe ending has gradually softened and become more forgiving, so it\'s not QUITE as bleak as I\'d originally imagined. Still, it was my intention all along to tell a story about sacrifice, about the value of one life to defend a community, so it remained the core of the plot and, especially, this climax."

  text: "One unexpected wrinkle that I failed to anticipate was the impact of the (possible) love story on the overall theme. I\'d intended it as a way to heighten the stakes, to make the player more keenly feel what is at risk and what can be lost. You aren\'t just clicking on a collection of pixels, but thinking about how this sacrifice will affect the feelings of characters within the story."

  text: "That said, I think that the introduction of romance ended up muddling the theme a little. It\'s hard to add love to a story without turning it into a love story, and once it becomes a love story, that aspect can overwhelm everything else. I think a lot of players end up making these decisions based on how they perceive their relationship with their love interest, and not their relationship with the wider community on Earth.\n\nWhich isn\'t at all to say that players are wrong to think this way! It\'s just not what I imagined. If I had to do it over again, I probably would have omitted the romance arc from this game and saved it for a future project."

  text: "Up until the alpha test, there was one outcome where, if you chose to stay behind and your love interest was on board, they would leave the escape pod before it ejected and stay by your side at the end.\n\nI nixed that after my tester revolted, but it\'s part of the reason why the love interest doesn\'t speak at your funeral in this scenario."

  text: "If you leave a love interest behind, but someone else is in love with them, then that other person will stay behind on their own volition. This might be the darkest ending in the game, but was very important for me. I wanted to give these characters as much agency as possible, and it\'s important that they have their own values and desires, and not merely fulfill the player character\'s will."

  text: "I wrote two especially rare potential endings. Some players might have felt particularly attached to Valiri or Desorn, and continued to observe their relationship, never pursuing another romance. I didn\'t want to encourage this: I think the game is more impactful when one love segues into the other. But I wanted to honor the players who followed the emotionally difficult path of \"staying faithful\" to their original love interest. In this case, there\'s a final message of sorts from the slain elf, perhaps imparting a bit of peace to your player character before you cross over."
