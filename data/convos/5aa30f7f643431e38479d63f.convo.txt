  text: "Camelot is sort of the counterpart to the Mojave: instead of getting boosted magic, your magic vanishes altogether, unless you are holding the Mana Mill.\n\nI\'ve long wanted to do something in space, but the lore and story challenges to it have been difficult.

  text: "The mission ended up being relatively short. I\'d initially imagined a longer multi-level combat crawl, but more combat increases the risk of losing teammates. Because your teammates play a crucial role at the end of the level, I wanted to make the early part before the boss fight relatively easy."
