  text: "The demon is one of the less lore-friendly things I\'ve done. It\'s kind of an instance of me going \"Uh..... magic!\" Honestly, he/it was less compelling than the doppelganger stuff leading up to it, but I still wanted to put a cap on the mission and have a boss-fight-type-thing.\n\nI used the same portrait and character model as the Adversary from Glory\'s loyalty mission, but in my mind this is a different malevolent spirit/entity. Something that has lurked in this spot for some time, quietly drawing power to itself and siphoning off victims who wander too deep."

  text: "I didn\'t want to make this boss fight too difficult. Depending on who you brought along, your player character might be close to dead by now. But I did want to keep it interesting, so it has a fairly simple enemy-spawning mechanic. You can defeat the adds as they appear to limit the enemy\'s total damage output, or focus fire on the demon to try and end the fight early."

  text: "Defeating the demon grants you the mana mill, which might seem like a red herring but is, lore-wise, very important for the final mission. Big props to the r/Shadowrun subreddit for pointing me at some resources that could plausibly allow players to cast magic in space. I wanted to make this artifact sound rare enough that AAA launch teams wouldn\'t habitually carry them into orbit, hence the descriptions of its immense age and such. Lofwyr\'s interest in it also lends credence to the idea that it\'s a rare and powerful object."
