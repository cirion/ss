The outcome will reverberate through to the end of the game.\n\nThe outcomes of this choice are asymmetrical, with some offering superior benefits. Siding with Renraku will give you a significant payday immediately. Siding with Novatech gives you greater rewards later in the game. And deleting the certificate will get you absolutely nothing."

You\'ll consider how your runner feels about the megacorps, how much you trust other people, what kind of future you want for CalFree, what path will lead to that future. Making a choice that you believe is morally right, even when it disadvantages you, is a lot more powerful than doing something \"good\" just because it has a better reward."

  text: "I get annoyed with the \"morality\" systems used in many video games. Back in the 2000s, there were a bunch of games with dumb, reductive, binary good-or-evil \"choice\" systems. Games like Fable, Bioshock 1, or Fallout 3 pretended to be choice-based, but really you were only making a single decision at the start of the game: did you want to be a \"good guy\" or a \"bad guy\"? Then you just hit the \"good\" button or the \"bad\" button for every choice for the rest of the game."

My least-favorite example was in BioShock Infinite, which implied that it\'s just as wrong to fight AGAINST slavery as it is to fight FOR slavery. Ugh! Just because not EVERYTHING has a right or wrong answer does not mean that NOTHING is right or wrong."

  text: "So, what kind of decisions SHOULD we have in games? I\'m a fan of choices in games like Dragon Age, which are meaningful and situational. There\'s no one single system that will guide you in every choice you make. You\'re forced to consider the context, the consequences, the impacts on the people you care about, your character\'s philosophy. To me, that feels most true to the big choices we struggle with in real life."

In addition to stealing secrets from rivals and deceiving government officials, they fostered a culture of rampant sexual abuse and HR coverups. As part of their damage control and PR rehab, they donated millions of dollars to charities that help prevent and treat sexual assault."
