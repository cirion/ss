  text: "The store sign is probably the most obvious environmental change in the library. I was restricted to the \"S A L E\" letters used in Reliable Matthew\'s shop in Hong Kong: I don\'t have the necessary art skills to create my own letters. But restrictions generate creativity, and it was a fun challenge to think of all the ways I could rearrange them."

  text: "As with much of the dynamic content in the hub, I needed a way to keep track of all the variations and try to maintain tonal consistency. It would be jarring to have people acting happy after a disaster, or if they acted sad after a triumph. During my design phase, I created a huge spreadsheet that listed all the missions, all of the changeable elements in the library, and what would happen when."

  text: "This is especially tricky for a semi-linear game like this, where players can choose to run missions in varying orders. Having a single authoritative list of what I planned to do made it much easier to track my tasks, and allowed me to ensure it made logical and emotional sense before I got too far along with creating it."
