And, other players don\'t hesitate before clicking. Which is also great! Each person who plays this game is different, and I\'m delighted to see this character and scenario prompting such different reactions."

The Walt Disney Company has actually done some very good work in recent years, using its immense wealth and influence to produce diverse, interesting, relatively progressive movies. They\'ve stood their ground even when threatened with boycotts by people who dislike the pluralistic values of their new movies."

  text: "Is Disney doing this because they are brave, because they are pure, because they are righteous?\n\nNope! Disney is a for-profit capitalist corporation, motivated entirely by their responsibility to their shareholders. They have crunched the numbers, looked at emerging demographics, and come to the conclusion that they can be more profitable by producing content that is feminist, multicultural, socially aware."

This first choice is about you as a leader and influencer. The second choice is about you as a piece of meat.\n\nI try to avoid judging the player for their action, so if you decide to accept this second offer, you can have a good time. Still, it isn\'t intended as a purely titillating excursion. Ideally you\'ll feel some level of uneasiness while events unfold."

She treats you similarly to how, say, Geralt treats his sexual conquests in the first Witcher game, and players may not be accustomed to being used in that way."

In this particular case, there\'s an even greater variation depending on your character\'s gender. Even though any type of character can get with Dorbi, she does still have certain preferences and deep-rooted desires, and I wanted to draw that out in this scene, instead of just making her a playersexual mirror."

No matter how badly she wants to rule the world, sometimes she needs the companionship of another body.\n\nShe can only let her guard down in these moments where there\'s no risk of romantic entanglement, no risk of falling in love. She refuses to be vulnerable, and, if you look real hard, you might be able to see the glint of loneliness that\'s buried deep within her core."
