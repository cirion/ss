  text: "When I play a game that offers a pacifist route, I almost try to take it. I\'m a big fan of games like Planescape: Torment, Thief: The Dark Project, Deus Ex, and the Metal Gear games, all of which allow you to bypass most combat.\n\nIn those games, the peaceful route is usually the \"best\" one, either from a story or a mechanical perspective. It may be harder than fighting, and is always more complicated, but yields a superior outcome."

  text: "For CalFree in Chains, I wanted the choice of \"quiet or loud?\" to be a little more nuanced. The peaceful route will be slower, but is also safer. You might get a small karma reward for completing the level without combat. Is that really the \"right\" thing to do, though?\n\nEspecially on replays, players might have second thoughts. The Protectorate is dangerous, inflicting immense harm on CalFree. If you fight some of them here, will that make life easier for people elsewhere?"
