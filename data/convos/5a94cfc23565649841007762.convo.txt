  text: "The MPA may seem slightly toned down from how they were portrayed in The Caldecott Caper. More importantly, though, the PU has become radicalized and the world has become more dangerous. The MPA still believes in the same goals and methods as they always have, but those actions are much more tolerable in an open military conflict than they were in the chilly peacetime before."

  text: "I really value the Metahuman People\'s Army and their role as a potential rival to, rather than an adversary of, the People\'s University. Hopefully it encourages players to think through their own values and decide how to roleplay their character. There\'s some typical \"do the ends justify the means?\" stuff, but also questions about what those ends ARE, and whether the means will actually be effective. Is it better to do something than to do nothing? Is it ALWAYS better? How much should you care about hearts and minds, and how much about actual results?"

The MPA aren\'t intended as a stand-in for Antifa, but I suspect that many people will react to them similarly. \"Oh, of course I agree with their GOALS, but their ACTIONS...\""

  text: "Your player character\'s choices regarding the MPA may mirror your choices regarding Novatech. Depending on your values, you might appreciate the MPA\'s goals while opposing their tactics, while you appreciate Novatech\'s actions but despise their motivation.\n\nI REALLY wish I had access to analytics data about what players chose! I\'m very curious how many people accept the support of the corps, the support of the insurgents, or recruit both for a big-tent coalition, or decide to go it alone with an ideologically-pure People\'s University."
