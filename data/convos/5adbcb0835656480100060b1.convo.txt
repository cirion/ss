  text: "Tassender is kind of a living MacGuffin. He provides the initial motivation for you to assemble your team and go do stuff. I had to be very careful while describing him and his role: the entire point of the People\'s University is that they don\'t have any leaders, so I had to explain why it was so important that he be rescued."

  text: "I initially used a different portrait for Tassender. Late in development, I belatedly realized that most of the speaking members in the People\'s University had white skin, which is very jarring and unrealistic for an organization based in Berkeley and Oakland.\n\nI think I\'d gotten used to thinking of diversity in terms of Shadowrun metatypes, which are analogous to but not synonymous with real-world races."

  text: "In Shadowrun canon, race and metatype are orthogonal: you can have Hispanic elves, Asian elves, Asian orks, white orks, etc. I\'d focused on metatype diversity but not racial diversity.\n\nAnyways, I\'m glad that I caught that and was able to make a more representative People\'s University before release. The new Tassender looks hella cool, too!"

  text: "I knew early on that I wanted Tassender to survive, since I think many players will expect him to die and fuel a revenge plot. I wanted to give him some meaningful dialogue when he finally returns late in the game. This helps a little with overall content balance, since you might have exhausted available dialogue from some long-serving characters like Kora."

  text: "Thematically, these dialogues mostly focus on big-picture ideas: the purpose of the People\'s University and your legacy within it. These questions have been asked since the beginning of the game, and by now you may have developed stronger opinions about and desires for the organization. Your choices here don\'t really have a mechanical impact on the remainder of the game, but I think they help establish the stakes and reinforce the importance of your mission."

  text: "For a while, I was considering making Tassender another one-night-stand option, to parallel Dorbi\'s proposition in Monterrey. I wasn\'t able to make it work, though. My initial crack at it was overly focused on his victimhood and suffering, which made it feel weirdly exploitative. I tried another angle where the liaison was born out of intellectual and philosophical vigor, a sapiosexual contrast to Dorbi\'s base physical craving, but it felt super-stilted and unrealistic. I eventually regretfully punted on it... I would have liked to fit in one more romance scene, but not anything that I was unhappy with."

  text: "Tassender\'s ultimate role in the story ends up being very limited, but he\'s the only character, along with Lina, who is guaranteed to survive all the way through to the end, and so will have a significant impact on events to come. Your conversations here in the library will likely color your understanding of exactly what happens in the epilogue."
