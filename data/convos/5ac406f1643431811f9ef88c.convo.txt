  text: "This shooting range is very similar to a similar one I made in Redding Old City Hall near the end of Antumbra Saga. I improved it a little this time, adding a variety of attack animations and performing some math so the volume of the attacks can vary based on your distance from the shooter."

  text: "It did produce some new bugs, which took me a while to work through. To make this seem natural, a random amount of time passes between each attack. I stop the attacks whenever the player leaves the basement, and schedule a new attack when they return or after an old attack finishes. But if the player rapidly left and returned, or reloaded a saved game in the basement, multiple attacks could end up being scheduled simultaneously, eventually leading to a cacophony of overlapping bullets and eventually a crashed game."

  text: "Narratively, the shooting range indicates the increasing militarization of the PU and how seriously they are taking their new mission. You\'re witnessing the training that other characters are talking about. I do like the juxtaposition of the military fighting right next to the eventual nightclub: work and play, hate and love, noise and music all thrown together."
