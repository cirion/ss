  text: "I could never get drone vents to work properly in my earlier campaigns, but this time around I spent extra time to figure them out and incorporate them. Much like matrix content, I never want to gate any mission-critical items behind a drone vent. They\'re ideal for alternate solutions to quests or moderate bonuses, to reward players who have invested in drone skills or brought along Masato."

If you DO bring your drones, though, you\'ll feel validated by the unique weapon and extra loot you can find inside."

  text: "Stuff like this also helps keep the game feeling fresh for those who choose to replay the game. Since you can\'t take every companion on every run, each one will play out slightly differently: not just in dialogue, but in the additional items and solutions you\'ll find within each mission."
