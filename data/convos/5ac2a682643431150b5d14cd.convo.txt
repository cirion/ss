  text: "It took AGES for me to set up the various seating animations for the restaurant. It\'s easy enough for the nonspeaking characters, who I can just sort of squeeze in wherever, but for characters who can actually sit and stand and move, just one or two pixels can mean the difference between \"Oh yeah, that looks fine\" and \"That person is not occupying our physical reality!\""

  text: "I\'m not sure why I was so attracted to the idea of a restaurant setting in the hub, but I am. Part of it might be that sharing food with people is such an elemental form of bonding: it\'s how families and squads and tribes grow close to one another."

  text: "Depending on the romance you pursue, you might have a \"date\" or two here. It\'s probably the most boring, clich\303\251 date imaginable: you meet at a restaurant, eat a meal together, listen to some music, then wander through a park. But as common as it is in the real world, it actually isn\'t something depicted often in video games (at least not in the RPGs I\'ve played), so I really wanted to do it here. Certain players might even find this more compelling, if it reminds them of their own experiences and allows them to more deeply identify with their player character."

  text: "In addition to the major scenes that take place here, you\'ll occasionally find a crew member just chilling in this space. It\'s a pretty casual place for them to be, and hopefully also supports the impression that they\'re a real person who goes about their normal life when they\'re not busy fighting tyranny with you."
