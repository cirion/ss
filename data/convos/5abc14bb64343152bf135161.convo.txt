The survivors will respond differently depending on who was chosen for that final price.\n\nOn an individual level, your remaining crew will have different plans depending on how you influenced them over the course of the game. For example, Arelia might remain with the People\'s University as a battle medic, or she might cross behind enemy lines to care for the Protectorate citizens who have been wounded by the conflict."

It seems unrealistic, for one: after all, your love interest has also formed a bond with the other person, and would be mourning their loss. In the medium term, your shared grief may actually bring the two of you closer together. That isn\'t a typical ending for a video game, but that makes me like it even more. I made the epilogue a little more upbeat so it wouldn\'t end on QUITE so down of a note."
