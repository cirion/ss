It seems unrealistic, for one: after all, your love interest has also formed a bond with the other person, and would be mourning their loss. In the medium term, your shared grief may actually bring the two of you closer together. That isn\'t a typical ending for a video game, but that makes me like it even more.

I eventually realized that the engine was hard-coded to play a certain track as the credits started to roll, so instead I inserted an intermediate song to transition between the funeral and the credits. The sound is a bit more upbeat, which is another touch that hopefully helps soften the blow of your loss."

If you choose to stand alone, then the PU is defeated as a cohesive entity, but becomes an inspiring example for many individuals to follow. I cast both of these as fairly upbeat outcomes, not dwelling on the morally compromised position the PU occupies in the former case, or the widespread deaths of your friends in the latter case."
