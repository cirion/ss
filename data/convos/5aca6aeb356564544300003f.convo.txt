  text: "Masato was the final crew member who I really developed. He ended up filling in a few gaps for gameplay and narrative reasons. There wasn\'t already a rigger, so I made him a rigger. There weren\'t any humans, so I made him a human. The party was skewing female, so I made him a male."

  text: "That said, once I started planning him out, I had a lot of fun with him. Especially since he isn\'t a romance interest and isn\'t really essential to the plot, I felt a bit more free to give him rough edges. He\'s an asshole, an elitist, a hipster. But that doesn\'t keep him from being charming, good-natured, and honest."

  text: "One very important role Masato plays is to demonstrate the variety of opinions and personalities within the Japanese Imperial State. Keiji Saito is obviously the main villain of the game, and there are many negative examples of Japanese soldiers and megacorps. I don\'t want players to walk away with the impression \"Japanese == Bad\" any more than I would want them to think \"Orks == Bad\". Having an ally like Masato hopefully allows the player to separate their criticisms of governmental policy from the ethnic group."

  text: "But, even though Masato criticizes Saito\'s status quo, he still benefits from it. He ended up being a very useful vehicle for exploring themes of privilege and power. Masato CHOOSES to join the resistance, and is in a very different situation from the metahumans who have been forced into it by the Protectorate. Masato can remain with the PU for as long as it amuses him, or as long as he feels it aligns with his values, but at any moment he could leave and return to a life of safety and (relative) luxury. People like Isao don\'t get that choice: they must help the opposition, or else face death."

  text: "While Masato is likeable, he\'s fundamentally selfish. Even his apparently altruistic values are rooted in self: he cares about the reputation of the Japanese state and worries about how Saito is damaging it, but mostly because he doesn\'t want to be personally blamed for that reputation."

  text: "Given this imperfect moral code, I debated whether to proceed with my plan to make Masato an out gay man. I didn\'t want it to seem like his sexual orientation was another character flaw or somehow responsible for his outlook. I\'m pretty happy with how it turned out, though. In real life, people can be gay and frustrating just like people can be straight and frustrating. It can sometimes be annoying in media when subgroups are portrayed as perfectly morally pure: I think it\'s more compelling when they have flaws of their own, so long as those flaws don\'t completely define their character."

  text: "It may take you some time to discover Masato\'s orientation and family situation. He isn\'t intentionally reserved about these topics, they just aren\'t things that typically come up in early conversation with an employer; depending on what dialogue options you pursue, you might learn about his home life early, later, or not at all. Again, I wanted to avoid defining Masato by any one thing. This is a part of his life, but not the only part, and it\'s one of the less relevant things to impact your current mission."

  text: "Masato is always at ease in any environment, and readily connects with the other crew members and residents of the library, but never fully bonds with the group. Which is understandable: he has his own life and his own family, which for him takes top priority.\n\nI think his relationship with Isao is interesting. It\'s an asymmetric relationship, and I don\'t think they ever fully understand one another."

  text: "Having played through the game myself a few times, I suspect that most players\' impression of Masato will vary depending on how often they take him on missions. If you mostly leave him chilling back at base, he probably comes off as more annoying, being an occasional contrarian to your cause.\n\nWhen he comes on runs, though, you can witness his irreverence directed at other people besides yourself, which probably makes him seem more fun and more interesting."
