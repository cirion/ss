  text: "I really like dogs, and decided early on that I wanted to add one to this campaign. I wanted to avoid just copying Dante from Dragonfall, though, so I did what I could to differentiate them.\n\nI wasn\'t able to change the 3D body model - those are built into the game engine, and you can\'t modify them or add new ones. I could have replaced the face portrait, but I can\'t draw and didn\'t want to steal anyone else\'s art, so I just made a slight modification to the Dante portrait."

  text: "One change that I thought would be easy was updating gender: Dante was a boy dog, so yours would be a girl dog. This turned out to be surprisingly difficult! The Shadowrun game engine combines gender and character models, so if you ever viewed your dog in the party menu, they would be described as \"Male\".\n\nI ended up placing the dog on a separate team from you, so you never see them in the party menu. This required some additional work, but I was happy with the result, especially since the dog ends up moving differently from Dante and from other party members. She doesn\'t respect the party formation: she just sort of chills for a while, then sees that you\'re leaving, and races to catch up with you."
