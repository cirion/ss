  text: "I really like dogs, and decided early on that I wanted to add one to this campaign. I wanted to avoid just copying Dante from Dragonfall, though, so I did what I could to differentiate them.\n\nI wasn\'t able to change the 3D body model - those are built into the game engine, and you can\'t modify them or add new ones. I could have replaced the face portrait, but I can\'t draw and didn\'t want to steal anyone else\'s art, so I just made a slight modification to the Dante portrait."

  text: "One change that I thought would be easy was updating gender: Dante was a boy dog, so yours would be a girl dog. This turned out to be surprisingly difficult! The Shadowrun game engine combines gender and character models, so if you ever viewed your dog in the party menu, they would be described as \"Male\".\n\nI ended up placing the dog on a separate team from you, so you never see them in the party menu. This required some additional work, but I was happy with the result, especially since the dog ends up moving differently from Dante and from other party members. She doesn\'t respect the party formation: she just sort of chills for a while, then sees that you\'re leaving, and races to catch up with you."

  text: "This caused a rare but unfortunate side-effect. Since the dog is no longer on your team, you can\'t path through her, and in certain circumstances she could trap you in a corner, forcing you to reload an earlier game. But, once again, solving this problem had a serendipitous outcome: after brainstorming a few potential solutions, I came up with \"petting the dog\", which is now one of my favorite parts of the game. Mechanically, the only purpose is to gracefully dismiss her so you can\'t get permanently stuck; but it also allowed me to write some more interactions with the dog, including random outcomes, so people who interact with her multiple times may occasionally be surprised by how she reacts."

  text: "The dog has absolutely no gameplay impact on the campaign: she doesn\'t give any bonuses or provide alternate solutions or anything. But I think that simultaneously makes her a lot more interesting and fun: it\'s purely a part of your character\'s story, something that connects you to the world instead of just providing more stats."
