  text: "Like a lot of my characters, Moonflower started off as just a portrait that I really liked, and over time I came up with the personality to match the portrait, and eventually the backstory to explain the personality. I like her a lot. She\'s a broken person who is filled with life, someone who has found their own way through an impossible situation."

  text: "As you get to know her better, you\'ll learn more about her history. This was largely inspired by the Ghost Ship fire, a local tragedy that struck several months before I started work on this game. It devastated communities here and, while the media has moved on, family and friends of the victims will always feel torn by their losses."

  text: "Moonflower is strongly shaped by this event, but hopefully not completely defined by it. You can catch glimpses of the light-hearted free-spirited person she used to be. As I see it, she was always in touch with her feelings; when her feelings got too painful to handle, she deliberately drowned them out, entering a whorl of drugs to deaden her senses and release her mind. Which sounds awful, but I try to avoid sounding judgmental. It\'s easy enough to say \"You should face your pain!\" when you haven\'t experienced that pain yourself."

  text: "Moonflower\'s story was originally even more tragic. When I started revising my initial draft, though, I was horrified to realize that, depending on the player\'s actions, a grand total of five lesbians (or bisexual women) might be killed over the course of the game. This is a trope that\'s so widespread that it has gotten its own name, \"Bury Your Gays\" or \"Dead Lesbian Syndrome\": for nearly a century, almost every time an explicitly queer character has entered a story, they must die, go insane, or otherwise be removed by the story\'s end. It\'s a really harmful and damaging trope that I\'ve complained about at length in the past, and yet somehow I had gone ahead and recreated it in my own story!"

  text: "Fortunately, I was able to recognize this and at least somewhat mitigate it. Some of the deaths are contingent on the player\'s actions and decisions, and I wasn\'t quite as concerned about those, but I really wanted to destroy the feeling of helplessness that comes with canon deaths. So I revisited Samantha\'s story, giving the possibility of a happy conclusion for these two."
