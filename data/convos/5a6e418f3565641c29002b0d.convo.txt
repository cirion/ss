  text: "Pliny\'s is strongly modeled off of Cato\'s Ale House, a pub I really like on Piedmont Avenue in Oakland. It\'s different enough that I didn\'t want to re-use the name, but I tried to capture a few elements of its layout and vibe.\n\nThat\'s true of most locations in this campaign. Corporate offices are generic, but most other levels are based on locations that I enjoy or find interesting."

  text: "This is one of the few times that you can see the MPA on their home turf, and they may seem more sympathetic here than they did outside on Piedmont Avenue. Like the People\'s University, they are an eclectic and unruly bunch, championing the metahuman cause against the threats of the Protectorate. Unlike the PU, they are almost exclusively focused on their militant mission, and have little tolerance for activities that do not directly advance their cause."
