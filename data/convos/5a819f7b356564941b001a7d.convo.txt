  text: "The Mojave desert\'s unusual magical properties are detailed in the \"California Free State\" source book. I thought it would be fun and add some extra flavor to incorporate them into this mission.\n\nShadowrun lore describes a variety of potential magical environments, including areas with high background count, Sites of Power, and dead mana zones. The Shadowrun game engine does not directly support these, but it does provide the underlying tools that can be used to build this effect."

  text: "I went back and forth on whether to boost Qi Casting. From my understanding of the 3rd edition PnP Shadowrun rules, a high-mana zone like the Mojave would boost ACTIVATED qi abilities, but not PASSIVE ones. Unfortunately, there doesn\'t seem to be a good way to separate these two within the game. I ultimately decided to leave Qi Casting unboosted, partly because if I boosted it here, I would also need to penalize it in a mana dead zone that appears later."

  text: "The actual coding is pretty simple. I check each character on your team to see if they have a magic-related stat (Spellcasting, Conjuring, Spirit Control, etc.) that is greater than zero. If so, I apply a buff that boosts that stat, as well as play a magical animation effect on them.\n\nLore-wise, your enemies should receive this buff as well. Fortunately for you, the Protectorate doesn\'t exactly embrace mages, and you won\'t face any Awakened enemies during this run."
