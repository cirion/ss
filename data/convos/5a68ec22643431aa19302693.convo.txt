  text: "Games get boring if you do the same things over and over again, so I try to make my levels distinct. Not just the visual look of the level and the factions you encounter, but the design of the level itself.\n\nHalferville is a bit distinct in that it is a single contiguous environment: you\'re essentially running a corridor from start to finish, overcoming obstacles along the way but never transitioning to another area. This sets it apart from other levels that might feature inside and outdoor maps, or different floors in a building."

  text: "If you\'ve played The Caldecott Caper before, this will feel somewhat familiar. I built this map with the same basic tile pieces and overall aesthetic. You\'ll see gems embedded in the walls, marble in the wealthier areas, and lots of dirt in the neighborhoods under construction. There isn\'t any direct map re-use, though. This is a fresh zone in Halferville that might not have even existed during the earlier events back in 2057."
