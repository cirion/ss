  text: "And now, the chamber of horrors reaches its possibly-surprising conclusion. In my mind, your party, panting and nerves frayed, bursts out of the macabre killing field, and suddenly into the sterile, cool assurance of the command center, where you see none other than your old foil Dorbi holding court.\n\nThe mission you\'ve beaten is the most difficult in the campaign, and that\'s deliberate: I want to push you, to use the gameplay to make you feel discomforted, vulnerable, angry. This is where we tilt into the final act, and I want you to FEEL the Protectorate as a threat, not merely BELIEVE them to be."

  text: "Of course, some players will cruise through here with little difficulty. For the majority who find it a challenge, though, the sudden reverse-betrayal of Dorbi will carry extra weight. It\'s not merely interesting that she\'s on your side, it\'s HELPFUL: she is, after all, an extremely powerful mage, who remains at full health, while your own party may be battered and bloodied by now. She doesn\'t just SAY that she\'s on your side: she SHOWS it, joining you at a critical juncture and guiding you to a successful conclusion."

  text: "Dorbi is a controversial character, and I like to lean into the various aspects of her character. Her timely intervention here may tempt players to overlook her previous hostility or inaction. I really enjoy pitting gameplay against narrative: her current actions can lead you to believe one thing while her past behavior would suggest the opposite."
