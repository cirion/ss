  text: "You may have earlier met Rick near the conclusion of Antumbra Saga. He\'s a stereotypical California Ranger: Irreverent, principled, results-oriented, enthusiastic, dangerous. I always thought the character was fun, so when I was thinking of Antumbra Saga characters to bring forward, he was an easy choice. The Rangers will play a significant role in the eventual overthrow of Saito, so he was also a useful window into that world."

  text: "I think he works OK, but he ended up feeling less interesting than most of my other NPCs. Upon further reflection, that\'s probably because I essentially gave him a desk job, which removed a lot of the kinetic energy that I had liked about him before. In retrospect, I should have explored some ways to make him more of a field agent, perhaps making him a non-playable teammate such as a personal rigger who chauffeurs you to your destination. Or invested more time in his personal story; you don\'t get to know him as well as you do the other merchants."

  text: "On the other hand, I am decently happy with how his side-quest turned out. The transmitter-planting mission is basically a rip-off of the nirnroot quest from Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Thematically, you are leaving something instead of taking something, but mechanically they are identical: you\'re trained to listen for a sound, then you explore until you find where the sound is loudest, then you click on a thing."

  text: "It\'s pretty simple, but it\'s also different from the sidequests in my other campaigns, so I think the variety is nice. I\'m happy whenever I can come up with something that isn\'t just \"Talk to this person\" or \"Shoot that person\". This puzzle would have been much more difficult in the Dragonfall engine, but the addition of \"ambient audio nodes\" in Hong Kong made it a breeze to implement, since it could automatically adjust the volume based on the player\'s distance."

  text: "The rewards for this are pretty straightforward: you get a bit of cash for each transmitter you plant. I deliberately kept this value a little low. You\'re rewarded for completing the quests, but hopefully won\'t feel too punished if you miss them. Some players may have trouble hearing the sounds, while others don\'t have the patience to go hunting, so it isn\'t required, just a little bonus."

  text: "I\'m pleased with myself for adding the initial tutorial in the library. Making games has given me a much better appreciation for why developers do things in their own games: by walking players through the steps in a controlled environment, I can be confident that they understand how to complete the quest, and give them some early incentives for doing so."
