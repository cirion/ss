  text: "In my continuing quest to defy stereotypes, Arelia is an atypical troll: shy, nervous, softhearted. She\'s still big and physically strong, and can look the part of a hulking brute, but does not think that way at all.\n\nShe\'s literally sympathetic: she feels the pain of those around her, and struggles to deal with the increasing amounts of pain brought on by the new state of the world."

  text: "Her primary dilemma is just how far that sympathy should extend. Are Saito\'s followers as deserving of love and support as Tassender\'s recruits? Is it right to help those who seek to hurt others? Her head says \"No\" but her heart says \"Yes\", and she\'ll look to you for support as she struggles through this moral minefield."

  text: "Writing Arelia came very naturally for me. In real life I have a slight stammer, and I gave her my speech patterns, with short pauses indicated by ellipses. Our actual outlooks are quite different: I\'m much sunnier and more optimistic than her, but the rhythms of our speech are almost identical."

  text: "I was a little uncertain of Arelia\'s planned loadout when I initially designed her, and worried that I was spreading her too thin by diversifying her across melee and spellcasting. In practice, I think it works rather well. A lot of her spells are oriented towards support and don\'t need to be especially powerful.\n\nHer combat isn\'t as strong as someone who specializes in it, but it does give you some good options for flushing enemies out of cover."

This allowed me to do some potentially-interesting things later in the game with dead-mana zones, since I could control the number of characters I needed to account for."

  text: "I smiled frequently while writing Arelia\'s romance. There\'s drama and pathos and angst, but she\'s so heartfelt and earnest that it soars for me.\n\nWith the longer running time of CalFree in Chains versus The Caldecott Caper, I wanted to have a more involved romantic arc, and I really enjoyed having multiple bumps in the road along the way. Finding that your loved one has flaws, and accepting them for those flaws, is so much more powerful than finding the perfect mate."

  text: "If you pursue a romance, Arelia falls very deeply in love with you, but her love does not define her. It was very important to me to show that she\'s still engaged with the world around her, that she still feels the hurt of the Protectorate. Love is a wonderful thing, but it doesn\'t solve everything, and if you share her love, you should understand the pain that she feels."

  text: "I was a little worried that I was making Arelia too typically \"feminine\": she embodies traditional values like compassion and nurturing and emotional availability. As a standalone character I might take pause at that, but I think that in the context of all my characters it\'s fine: after traveling with Persi and Dorbi and Valiri and Kali and many others, Arelia feels unique in her own way, providing yet another example of someone finding how to live their life in the Sixth World."
