  text: "This is kind of an odd mission. It\'s less integrated into the main plot than any of the other runs: you\'re ostensibly here to acquire shuttle launch codes, but that\'s really just a MacGuffin to lead you through the level. This could easily be a stand-alone mission, or slightly modified and dropped into almost any other Shadowrun campaign."

  text: "Despite not having much to do with the Protectorate or Saito, this mission does gain some integration in the form of reactivity. In particular, your earlier decisions at Fuchi HQ will reverberate here, including the possibility of acquiring a unique weapon if you supported Novatech. There are even some obscure consequences possible, such as an alliance with a new character if you murdered Brian but still provided the keys to Novatech."

  text: "Since we\'re away from the Bay Area proper and out on a limb plot-wise, this was a good opportunity to handle some of the CalFree lore that I wasn\'t able to work into any of my other campaigns. Toxic magic is a big factor in the state, particularly along the Big Sur coastline. Secret research facilities occupy many remote areas. And we can focus a bit more on the corporate shakeup as Novatech continues the process of seizing Fuchi\'s assets."
