  text: "Cut-scenes are hard and a persistent source of problems. I have more bugs related to them than anything else, so I\'ve included fewer and fewer of them as I\'ve made more campaigns. They can still be impressive, though, so I still add them when I think it\'ll have an impact.\n\nThis one particular scene probably takes less than thirty seconds to play out, but I\'ve spent over a dozen hours on it, testing it hundreds of times to make sure it can\'t get stuck. This campaign would have more cut-scenes if they didn\'t take so long to get right!"

  text: "I swear that I\'m not a sadist in real life. When designing games, though, I am drawn to creating stressful situations that may hurt the player\'s feelings. This particular scenario can unfold in different ways, but it\'s set up so I can determine what would be the meanest thing to do, and then do that thing. Valiri and Desorn always die, but who kills who and how will be determined by which character you seem most attached to.\n\nI was concerned that this would be too reminiscent of a similar situation in The Caldecott Caper, so I worked to differentiate this further. The result is, uh, probably crueler. Sorry about that!"

  text: "One major theme of CalFree in Chains is \"You can\'t stop bad things from happening, but you can choose how you will respond to those bad things.\" That often comes down to choices in dialogue, but can be even more powerful when expressed in gameplay. You\'re faced with an impossible decision here: do you kill your companion quickly and painlessly when they beg you to, or do you wait until they force your hand? Or do you continue to refuse? They\'ll die no matter what, but there are some obscure outcomes possible, like refusing to attack them even after entering combat mode."

  text: "There\'s a common trope where the protagonist\'s lover/child/friend is brutally murdered by the villain, which motivates the protagonist to kill the villain. I wanted to avoid that in this game. Carli dies immediately, and not by your hand. There are still other villains out there, but it\'s clear that they disapproved of Carli\'s magical meddling and aren\'t directly to blame for what happened to Valiri and Desorn.\n\nI deliberately wanted to withhold catharsis. There\'s no easy release, no way to make yourself feel better. You need to sit with these feelings for some time. My goal here isn\'t to spur revenge: it\'s to spur grief, to reflect on the value of life, the importance of the bonds we create with other people and the fragility of those same bonds. This lays the groundwork for deeper character development in the remainder of the campaign."
