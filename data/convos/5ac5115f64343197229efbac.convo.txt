  text: "One major decision every RPG needs to make is how strongly to define a character\'s background. In one extreme, games with predefined protagonists like, say, Final Fantasy games will spell out a character\'s history and personality very explicitly. Other games like Elder Scrolls will give you a complete blank slate, providing no detail and allowing you to invent whatever you want."

  text: "In recent years, my personal preference has been to have at least some defined history, with a little freedom to choose your past and a lot more freedom to declare your personality. I personally find it a lot more inspiring for a game to say something like \"You grew up in a ghetto and betrayed your best friend to escape. How do you feel about that?\" than for it to say \"I dunno, you\'re here now, who cares?\""

  text: "One of Lina\'s biggest roles is to help you define your character\'s history. She gives in-character descriptions of the canonical elements that are important to this story: your childhood in the Bay Area, your roots in the community, your earlier contact with the People\'s University. And she also gives you a lot of opportunities to shape that history. By forcing you to answer questions, even questions that seem irrelevant, hopefully you\'re starting to think carefully and develop your player character. This might be a reflection of your own past and desires, or it might be some unique character that you\'re developing on the fly."

  text: "The commercial was largely inspired by the Opera House sequence of Final Fantasy VI, although I suspect most players will be more familiar with the play in The Witcher III, and I was delighted to see it pop up in Life Is Strange: Before the Storm. It\'s a fairly common trope by now, but a fun one: you observe a staged performance, are thrust into a speaking role, and must select the correct lines in order to achieve an optimal outcome. The specific lines available will vary based on the type of commercial you decided to shoot, adding more replayability and hopefully helping you feel more attached to the result."

Depending on the decisions you make later on, she may be the final character to speak with you, providing a sort of benediction based on familial love as your story reaches its conclusion. And, again depending on your decisions, she may prominently feature in the epilogue, leading the People\'s University into their next phase of existence."
