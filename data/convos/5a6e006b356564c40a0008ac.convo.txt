  text: "I really enjoyed creating various puzzles for the Antumbra games, and was bummed that I couldn\'t fit many into The Caldecott Caper. I sort of ran out of ideas: I didn\'t want to repeat any of the earlier ones, and couldn\'t think of good new ones.\n\nSo, when starting CalFree in Chains I prioritized bringing puzzles back. I devoted time to brainstorm and prototype different possibilities and figure out where I could fit them into the campaign."

  text: "The walls thing ended up being really fun to do. In the Shadowrun engine, each map section has three separate properties: whether you can see through it, whether you can walk through it, and whether you can shoot through it. For example, you can see through a bulletproof window, but can\'t walk or shoot through it. You can see and shoot over a chasm, but can\'t walk through it."

Hopefully you will be confused for a little while, try a couple of things that don\'t work, experiment a little more, then go \"Cool, that worked!\" Once you figure out the \"trick\", you use it a few more times, getting a better understanding of the relationship between the candles and the walls."

  text: "This ultimately contributes to the boss fight as well. As with his appearances in Antumbra, Shavarus has a puzzle element to his fight. Fortunately, it\'s the same puzzle you just solved in order to confront him. Much like solving the initial puzzle, you may be frustrated with the mechanics of this fight at first, before realizing what you must do to triumph. I wouldn\'t want to do this for every fight, but I think occasionally switching things up like this makes the game more engaging than having every battle play out the same way."

  text: "Of course, the downside to puzzles is frustrating players who have trouble solving them, which can bring progress to a grinding halt and cause people to quit the game. The Steam page for Antumbra includes a hints page for all of the puzzles and their solutions. That isn\'t ideal, though: people need to get annoyed enough to stop trying and go looking for help."

  text: "For CalFree in Chains, I added in-game hints. An invisible timer starts once the puzzle begins, and if you haven\'t solved it after a certain time, your crew will start offering suggestions. This should provide a more graceful experience: you still get a chance to solve it \"on your own\", and by the time they begin providing hints, hopefully you\'ll find them helpful rather than annoying."
