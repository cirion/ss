  text: "I reject the notion that each choice is equally valid or should have identical mechanical consequences. Sometimes they do. Sometimes the choice with the worst gameplay consequence will lead the best story consequence. And sometimes there really is a \"right\" and a \"wrong\" choice. The confrontation with Humanis is an example of the latter."

  text: "It fits the story: you\'re already aligned with the People\'s University and their metahuman allies, so of course Humanis isn\'t going to trust you to act in their interests. If you make the deal with Amy, she\'ll backstab you and you\'ll need to fight her anyways, under more dangerous conditions. Everyone on your team, even Masato, warns you that it\'s a bad idea."

  text: "Nonetheless, I think there\'s still value in offering this choice. Even if 95% of players decide to attack Amy, that\'s a meaningful decision on their part, and carries much more weight than it would if the choice was railroaded. The 5% who want to side with Humanis will no doubt be peeved, but I think the result is understandable, and should encourage them to reconsider the wisdom of siding with human supremacists."
