  text: "I had a VIVID picture in mind of how I wanted the doppelganger sequence to go down. I\'ve always enjoyed playing around with horror-esque levels in my campaigns, but the threat has always been external to your team. I thought it would be nicely disturbing and creepy for the sanctity of your crew to be violated: betrayal, ambush, murder, from the people you care for."

  text: "I wanted a specific progression: surprise when your first companion attacked you, then gradually escalating paranoia, culminating in the difficult choice of whether to strike the first blow against a seemingly-innocent subject.\n\nBut, of course, there\'s a twist. If you\'re romancing someone, that person is NOT a doppelganger. The most horrific outcome of all is for you to attack skillfully and confidently, damning them in the process. (The mood I was going for here is similar to an encounter near the end of the horror movie The Descent.)"

  text: "That\'s a fairly simple progression to describe, but actually scripting it took a lot of work. For example, if you\'re romancing Arelia, she shouldn\'t be the first person to \"turn\": you\'d have absolutely no reason to question her at that point. She should be saved for last, after a pattern has been established. But, if you\'re romancing Isao, then HE needs to be last. And you shouldn\'t see either of their doppelgangers if you didn\'t bring them on the mission. And what happens if one of them died outside?"

  text: "Everything got sorted eventually, but at release this was one of the buggier parts of the game, with confused players encountering duplicate conversations or encounters that didn\'t make sense for their personal game-state. I think this is all sorted now, thanks to the detailed bug reports I received."

  text: "The graphics for this were fun to do. I have zero artistic ability, but I did some basic image manipulation in GIMP to create the new eyes and the deteriorating doppelganger faces. The lighting during the fight was a blast, too: some scripting to darken the cave and shine a sinister spotlight on the enemy. This is the same effect that is used on your player character in Hong Kong when you have a waking vision. Here, I play it on the doppelganger and use a more sinister red color instead of the neutral white of the official campaign."
