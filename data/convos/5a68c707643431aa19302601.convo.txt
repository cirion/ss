  text: "These opening encounters with Valiri and Desorn accomplish several things at the same time. They\'re simple combat encounters that reacquaint you with the interface and start getting a feel for your character\'s build in a low-risk environment. They\'re also introductions to some important teammates of yours, and you get a sense of their personalities and goals."

  text: "When possible, I prefer to communicate through action instead of through conversation. It\'s one thing to hear Desorn say \"I don\'t believe in violence.\" But it may be a little more impactful if he cries out in despair at your aggression, or if he commiserates with you after your attempt at mercy is rebuffed."

  text: "There\'s some light reactivity in these conversations: Valiri and Desorn will respond differently after the fight depending on how you initiated it, whether you attacked first or waited for your opponent to make the first move. This requires some extra work on my part to track, so I don\'t do it for every fight, but I think it\'s worthwhile for an early encounter like this: again, my hope is that you will quickly get an understanding for who these people are, and seeing how they respond to your actions can be very powerful."

  text: "There\'s more reactivity in CalFree in Chains than there was in The Caldecott Caper. This adds some value to future replays, but even if someone only plays the game once, it will hopefully feel more meaningful, as they will see how their decisions are affecting their friends and the world around them."
