  text: "The Public Library is based on the Berkeley Central Library. Some of the spaces like the basement and the roof are imagined, but the main reading room and the lobby area are fairly faithful adaptations.\n\nI like this building a lot, and had fun finding ways to translate its design into a game while keeping it playable."

  text: "To me, this room is the epitome of the People\'s University. It\'s a chaotic mishmash of old and new, violence and culture, art and graffiti. At the same time, it hopefully feels like a welcoming space, filled with passionate people who care about their mission and one another."

  text: "The specific inhabitants of this room will change over time. I wanted to give the impression that your teammates are dynamic people with their own lives and interests outside of your mission, and one way to support that is to show them visiting different places and doing different things in between missions. These are also ways to develop their personalities outside of conversation. Someone bookish might spend time in the stacks looking for something to read, while a more social person will be chatting with others, and an outsider like Isao might seem a little awkward."

  text: "That also, hopefully, makes things more interesting. Positions change each time you return, so you can\'t follow the same circuit each visit. This could get frustrating if you needed to spend a long time hunting down each companion in order to complete necessary conversations, but I think the relatively small and simple design of the library helps minimize that risk. It doesn\'t take much time or effort to stick your head into each room during a single visit, and you\'ll likely want to visit most of these places anyways to visit the shops or perform other tasks."
