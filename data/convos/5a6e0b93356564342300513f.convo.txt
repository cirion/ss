  text: "The Caldecott Caper was released for Shadowrun Hong Kong, but I wrote most of the game on the Dragonfall editor before the game was released. After playing Hong Kong, I was very impressed by that game\'s mission design. Unlike Dead Man\'s Switch and Dragonfall, which were always combat-focused, Hong Kong included multiple missions that could be completed without killing anyone."

  text: "It was too late for me to make any updates for Caldecott, but I was inspired by those missions, and wanted to do something similar for CalFree in Chains. It took a LOT of work! When a mission doesn\'t rely on combat, I need to write a lot more dialogue, puzzles, and exploration in order to fill out the gameplay, and all of those take a lot more time to set up than fights. And I usually need to include fights anyways as an alternative route.\n\nIt takes me about three times as long to create a single pacifist mission as a standard combat-focused one, so I didn\'t make many of them. But I\'m glad that I did! They add more variety to the campaign, provide additional rewards for character builds, and can pose some interesting roleplaying opportunities."

  text: "As with the puzzle in the pinball museum at the start of the game, there are a bunch of potential solutions depending on your build and the companions you brought with you, ranging from social manipulation to hacking to sabotage. Players will only experience a fraction of the available content on a given playthrough, but I think it adds to the feeling of depth to have multiple routes available."
