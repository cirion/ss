  text: "The very first scene of my very first Shadowrun campaign featured a thunderstorm, so I thought it would be fun to bring one back again. The scripting for this is fairly simple: there\'s a random timer that counts down, then flashes a light a few times, followed by a thunder sound. HBS added a much better thunder sound into the later games, which has made the effect a lot more convincing."

  text: "This map combines some of the wild natural setting of Sweeney Ridge with the magical menace of the Mojave. It\'s based on a real location in San Francisco, with a strange and compelling history. I spent some time here while working on the mod, taking photographs and drawing sketches for later reference while building the in-game map."

  text: "That isn\'t to say that this is a hyper-realistic rendering or anything! My ultimate goal is to make a fun game, not to accurately recreate physical locations. So the sizes and relative positions of the walkways have changed, the pool has shrunk, I\'ve added some pillars and shrubbery to provide cover. But I think enough of the original is recognizable in here that, if a player is familiar with the source, they\'ll feel a nice little glimmer of familiarity."

  text: "Oh, random note: \"Low Ebb\" is a phrase from the R.E.M. song \"I Remember California\", one of my favorite tracks from that terrific band. It has a sinister, ominous tone that nicely matches the mood I had in mind for this run.\n\nEven without that association, though I think \"Low Ebb\" still works nicely as a mission name. To me it conveys decline, entropy, loss. The future will improve, but things will be bleak for a little while first."
