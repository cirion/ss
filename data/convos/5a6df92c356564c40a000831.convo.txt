  text: "Your decision in the confrontation with Slagarm the Proud has a significant impact on the remainder of the game, kicking off a series of choices related to the MPA and carrying through to the finale of the game.\n\nSome people may decide immediately whether to side with her, while others may struggle with it a little. Your real-world morals and your character\'s values may come into play, or you might be primarily driven by the immediate demands of the mission."

  text: "If you do spare her, and if Valiri is in your party, the two of them will have a heated argument. This was actually the first dialogue I wrote for this campaign, and it captures one of the major themes I wanted to explore (and that I\'m struggling with in my own life).\n\nIn my initial draft, Valiri was clearly in the right and Slagarm in the wrong. In the final version, Slagarm gets the last word and makes a more compelling argument. I tend to side more with Valiri, but when I can identify personal biases, I try to tilt my writing in favor of the opposing side. It\'s a helpful mental exercise for me, and also results in a more balanced game that hopefully is more interesting to play."
