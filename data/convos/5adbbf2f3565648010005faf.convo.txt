  text: "Like many of my characters, I initially selected Isao based on his portrait, then worked backwards from there to come up with his story and personality. This turned out very well for me. Blue-skinned orks are Oni, a Japanese metavariant, who are a major element in the history of Yomi Island. Given Keiji Saito\'s history with the island, there were major opportunities to tie a companion\'s story with the larger political arc."

  text: "Isao is the biggest outsider on your crew. He has no education, has spent most of his life on a cramped prison island, and has little experience with the modern world. But, despite this background, he is one of the most upbeat and optimistic members. Others are horrified by the status quo, but for Isao, it\'s far better than the world he comes from. Despite the brutal treatment he has endured, he has a firm belief in universal metahumanity, the equal value of all lives."

  text: "In each of my games so far, I\'ve designated one character to have unusual speech. In Antumbra Saga it was Emperor Norton, who used the royal \"we\" and esoteric vocabulary. In The Caldecott Caper it was Persi, who spoke in dialect with lots of contractions and slang. Isao steps into the unusual-speech role in CalFree in Chains. It\'s intended to show his status as a new language learner: he\'s only spoken Japanese until very recently, and his syntax has not yet adapted."

  text: "Initially, I saddled Isao with even more dialogue handicaps. He would confuse his singular and plural nouns (\"Many danger\" or \"This foods\"), and would drop articles (a, the, that).\n\nAfter a while, though, I started to feel like it was getting needlessly difficult to read. The point wasn\'t to make him hard to understand: it was to mark his outsider status."

  text: "My initial concept of Isao was as a bodyguard type of build, and some of that survived through to the end, although not as fully as I\'d hoped. Shadowrun doesn\'t really have much of a tanking role, but he has a couple of custom skills that can help manage threats, as well as indirect soaking of damage.\n\nHe offers some interesting synergies with Arelia or a PC caster. For example, he can make it safer to camp on an exposed dragonline."

  text: "Finding emotional stakes for Isao was a bit hard at first. He doesn\'t have any family or close friends, which sets him apart from the other People\'s University members.\n\nUltimately, though, I think that same isolation may help endear him to some players: you are probably the most important person in the world for him."

  text: "I was a little surprised at how easy it was to write Isao\'s romance arc. Partly because he isn\'t highly verbal, I was able to lean more on physical action: it\'s still emotional and heartfelt, just expressed along a different vector.\n\nSome great opportunities are also opened up by his background: you can help him navigate unfamiliar territory in (what\'s hopefully) a sweet, endearing way."

  text: "Unlike Valiri/Desorn or Persi/Sable, which were each exclusive, players have the option of simultaneously advancing their relationships with both Isao and Arelia. So, I was careful to make their romance arcs different from one another. They hit different beats at different times, and also have an overall different tone. Isao\'s romance gradually and subtly blossoms, with incremental escalations that neither of you are all that aware of at first. Arelia\'s is much more abrupt and dramatic, careening in and out. Arelia is maybe a little more needy, while Isao is a bit more generous."

  text: "Oh! One last note: Isao actually wasn\'t his initial name. I initially called him Isas, and created the entire game with that name. It wasn\'t until the alpha test that my first tester pointed out the unfortunate similarity to ISIS, which definitely wasn\'t an association I intended. I had to go back and rename him, updating something like 800 uses of his name. A bit of a pain, but now it\'s hard to think of him as being called anything else."
