  text: "I rewrote this opening scene more than any other part of the game. In my initial draft, the events of \"CalFree in Chains\" took place in 2064, shortly before Matrix Crash 2.0. The resistance to General Saito was already established, you were well-known within the People\'s University (but new to command), and Valiri and Desorn had been PU members for several months."

  text: "My goal was to set up a chain of events that would directly lead to Saito\'s overthrow. As I got further into the story, though, I realized that the opening felt a little slow and boring. There wasn\'t a strong sense of urgency, no particularly good reason why the summit was happening now."

  text: "I eventually rewrote the plot so it kicked off in the immediate aftermath of Saito\'s assault on Sacramento and the collapse of the Free State. This change immediately infused the story with that missing sense of urgency, as everyone you meet grapples with the huge changes underway.\n\nAs a bonus, the invasion takes place in late 2061, during the Year of the Comet. This was an especially eventful year in Shadowrun canon, which provided even more material for me to work with."

  text: "Fortunately, I was able to complete all of my revisions and get my story straight before I started actually scripting these levels. Changes like this become exponentially more difficult the further along you are, so it\'s worth investing extra time at the start of a project to make sure you\'re happy with the plan, which will help minimize unnecessary rework later."
