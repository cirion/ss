  text: "I created Mr. Beaumont to try and solve the problem of portraying Human Nation\'s threat. Unlike Humanis, which operates in the open, Human Nation is a highly secret conspiracy: few in number, wielding immense power behind the scenes.\n\nThey were foreshadowed near the end of The Caldecott Caper, and have been addressed by Gavan Banain in a previous email, so by this point the player should have a vague idea of what they stand for."

  text: "I wanted to clearly establish Mr. Beaumont and Human Nation as straight-up villains. Unlike many of the ambiguous or morally gray adversaries you encounter, these are bad dudes, and you won\'t have the choice to ally with them.\n\nNot that they would accept you even if you wanted to join! In addition to being corrupted by your association with metahumans, and possibly being Awoken yourself, by now you\'ve definitely SURGEd and are no longer considered human."

  text: "Writing this dialogue was a little painful. Beaumont\'s language is hateful, and tuned to be as cruel as possible to every member of your party. I also wrote metatype-specific insults for every player, so you\'ll receive different burns from him depending on who you, personally, are."
