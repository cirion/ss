  text: "When writing a mission, I try to set up a self-contained objective to accomplish, but also tie in to the overarching story. You\'ll gain some insight into the larger forces at play in the California Protectorate and their impact on the country.\n\nFor the Sacramento run, I wanted to provide some \"civilian\" perspectives. You can speak with various people who aren\'t especially ideological and aren\'t officially aligned with a faction, and can hear how they feel about the events you\'re involved with."

  text: "These NPCs echo various voices I\'ve heard from in the media lately, offering their thoughts on culture and society. The hazmat worker feels a deep antipathy towards metahumans, but frames his opinions in terms of economics and safety. The exterminator doesn\'t think much about metahumans one way or another, but notices the individuals who affect his life. And the plumber notices that the new boss is the same as the old boss: despite the rhetoric of the new leadership, the plight of disadvantaged humans is just as miserable now as it was before the invasion."

  text: "These characters\' personalities don\'t directly impact the game, and you\'re never asked to choose between them or anything. But I think it adds to the flavor, increases the sense of realism, and provides some good roleplaying opportunities as you decide how your character would react to their ideas."
