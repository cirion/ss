  text: "If you spend some time standing here, or most places in the Library, you\'ll eventually see someone walking past. These are people I call \"Routewalkers\". They\'re special nonspeaking characters who follow a predefined loop. This particular person will come up from the ladder in the computer room, walk over near the magic shop, smoke for a while, return to the ladder and descend to the lobby, where they will examine the posters for a while before continuing on their way."

  text: "This has absolutely zero impact on the gameplay, but I think it helps add to the sense of realness. Most people in the library just stand in place, potentially performing some activity but not moving around. A few characters wander in an area, such as the waitress in the restaurant and certain people in the reading room. But in a big, bustling building like the People\'s University, you would expect people to be constantly coming and going places, and I think the routewalkers help convey that impression."

  text: "It took a lot of scripting to set this up, but the scripts were fairly straightforward. I assign a special tag to the routewalker and tell him or her to walk to a destination.\n\nOnce they reach it, I order them to start an animation and set a timer. When the timer completes, I order them to walk to their next destination, and so on."

  text: "Once this was set up, I could create arbitrary characters and assign the routewalker tag to them, so they each look different but behave the same. From one visit to the next, you\'ll see different routewalkers out and about, but if you follow them around, you\'ll see they visit the same locations in the same sequence."

  text: "I had initially tried something like this WAY back in the Eclipse club in Antumbra Saga. At the time I ran into some technical limitations that caused the engine to slow down to a crawl.\n\nNow that I have a better grasp of how the engine works, I was able to create an even more elaborate version of this idea without any performance penalty."
